Find Peak Element in an Array (Java)
Problem Statement

A peak element in an array is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an array nums, find any peak element and return its index.
You may assume nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞ (virtual boundaries).

Example Problem
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: nums[2]=3 is a peak because it is greater than nums[1]=2 and nums[3]=1


Another example:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5
Explanation: Both nums[1]=2 and nums[5]=6 are peaks

Algorithm (Binary Search)

Step-by-step Approach

Initialize two pointers: low = 0, high = n-1

While low < high:

mid = low + (high - low) / 2

If nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1] → peak is at mid or left → high = mid

Else → peak is right side → low = mid + 1

Return low (or high) → index of a peak

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Java Code
public class PeakElement {

    public static int findPeak(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length - 1;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                // Peak is on left side (including mid)
                high = mid;
            } else {
                // Peak is on right side
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return low; // or high
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1,2,3,1};
        int peakIndex = findPeak(nums);
        System.out.println("Peak Element Index: " + peakIndex); // Output: 2
    }
}

Code Explanation

Compare mid with mid+1 to decide which side contains a peak

Binary search reduces search space logarithmically

Guaranteed to find any peak element

Dry Run (Example)
nums = [1,2,3,1]

low=0, high=3
mid=1 → nums[1]=2, nums[2]=3 → 2<3 → move right → low=2
low=2, high=3
mid=2 → nums[2]=3, nums[3]=1 → 3>1 → move left → high=2
low=2, high=2 → done

Return 2 → nums[2]=3 → peak

Test Case
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5
Explanation: Both indices are valid peaks
