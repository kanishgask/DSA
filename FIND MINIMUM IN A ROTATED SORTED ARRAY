Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Java)
Problem Statement

A rotated sorted array is an array that was originally sorted in ascending order, but then rotated at some pivot.

Given such an array nums, find the minimum element in O(log n) time.

Example Problem

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest element is 1


Another example:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

Algorithm (Binary Search Approach)
Step-by-step

Initialize two pointers: low = 0, high = n-1

While low < high:

Calculate mid = low + (high - low) / 2

Compare nums[mid] with nums[high]

If nums[mid] > nums[high] → minimum is right side → low = mid + 1

Else → minimum is left side (including mid) → high = mid

Return nums[low] → minimum element

Java Code
public class MinInRotatedSortedArray {

    public static int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length - 1;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                // Minimum is in right side
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Minimum is in left side including mid
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        return nums[low];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3,4,5,1,2};
        System.out.println("Minimum Element: " + findMin(nums)); // Output: 1
    }
}

Code Explanation

The key is comparing mid with high

If mid > high → minimum is after mid

Else → minimum is at mid or before

Binary search reduces time complexity to O(log n)

Dry Run (Example)
nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

low=0, high=4
mid=2 → nums[2]=5, nums[4]=2 → 5>2 → minimum in right → low=3

low=3, high=4
mid=3 → nums[3]=1, nums[4]=2 → 1<2 → minimum in left → high=3

low=3, high=3 → done

Return nums[3]=1

Test Case
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
