DSA Question 10: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Java)
Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example Problem:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", which has length 3.


Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 10^5

s consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces

Algorithm (Sliding Window + HashSet)

Step-by-step Approach:

Initialize a HashSet to store characters in the current substring.

Use two pointers: left and right to define the sliding window.

Iterate right from 0 to n-1:

If s[right] is not in set → add to set → update max length

If s[right] is already in set → remove characters from left pointer until s[right] can be added

Return the maximum length of the substring found.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Java Code
import java.util.HashSet;

public class LongestSubstring {

    public static int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, maxLen = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(right);

            // Remove characters until we can add current character
            while (set.contains(ch)) {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }

            set.add(ch);
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abcabcbb";
        System.out.println("Length of Longest Substring: " + lengthOfLongestSubstring(s)); // Output: 3
    }
}

Code Explanation

Sliding Window:

left → start of the substring

right → end of the substring

Window expands until a duplicate character is found

HashSet:

Tracks unique characters in the current window

If duplicate found → remove characters from left until duplicate removed

Max Length Calculation:

maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1)

Keeps track of longest substring without repeating characters

Dry Run (Example Problem)
s = "abcabcbb"

Step 1: left=0, right=0 → 'a' not in set → add → set={a} → maxLen=1
Step 2: right=1 → 'b' not in set → add → set={a,b} → maxLen=2
Step 3: right=2 → 'c' not in set → add → set={a,b,c} → maxLen=3
Step 4: right=3 → 'a' in set → remove 'a' at left=0 → left=1 → add 'a' → maxLen=3
Step 5: right=4 → 'b' in set → remove 'b' at left=1 → left=2 → add 'b' → maxLen=3
...
Final maxLen = 3


✅ Summary

Time Complexity: O(n) → each character added/removed at most once

Space Complexity: O(n) → HashSet stores unique characters
