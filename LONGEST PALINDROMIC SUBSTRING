Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

Example 1
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation:
"aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Approach: Expand Around Center
Key Idea

A palindrome expands from its center.

There are two types of centers:

Odd-length palindrome → center at one character
Example: "aba"

Even-length palindrome → center between two characters
Example: "bb"

So, for each index i, we:

Expand around (i, i)

Expand around (i, i + 1)

Track the maximum length found

Algorithm

Initialize start = 0 and end = 0.

For each index i in the string:

Find palindrome length with odd center (i, i)

Find palindrome length with even center (i, i+1)

Take the maximum of both.

If the found length is greater than current max:

Update start and end

Return substring from start to end.

Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(N²)

Space Complexity: O(1)

This solution is commonly expected in interviews.

Java Code
public class LongestPalindromicSubstring {

    public static String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";

        int start = 0, end = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

            // Odd length palindrome
            int len1 = expandFromCenter(s, i, i);

            // Even length palindrome
            int len2 = expandFromCenter(s, i, i + 1);

            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);

            // Update result if longer palindrome found
            if (len > end - start) {
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
                end = i + len / 2;
            }
        }

        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    // Helper method
    private static int expandFromCenter(String s, int left, int right) {

        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length()
                && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }

        return right - left - 1; // Length of palindrome
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "babad";
        System.out.println("Longest Palindromic Substring: "
                + longestPalindrome(s));
    }
}

Line-by-Line Code Explanation
Main Method
int start = 0, end = 0;


Tracks the best palindrome boundaries

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)


Try each index as a center

int len1 = expandFromCenter(s, i, i);


Checks odd-length palindrome

int len2 = expandFromCenter(s, i, i + 1);


Checks even-length palindrome

if (len > end - start)


Update answer if longer palindrome found

start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
end = i + len / 2;


Correctly computes new substring boundaries

Helper Function
while (left >= 0 && right < s.length()
        && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right))


Expands outward while characters match

return right - left - 1;


Returns palindrome length

Example Walkthrough
Input: "babad"

Centers checked:
b → "b"
a → "aba" (length 3)
b → "bab" (length 3)

Longest = "bab"
