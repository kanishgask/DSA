✅ DSA – NEXT SET | Question 7
Majority Element in Array (Java)
Problem Statement

Given an array nums of size n, find the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.
You may assume that a majority element always exists in the array.

Example Problem
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 appears 2 times, which is more than 3/2 = 1.5


Another example:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Algorithm (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
Step-by-step

Initialize:

candidate = 0

count = 0

Traverse the array:

If count == 0 → set candidate = current element

If current element == candidate → count++

Else → count--

Return candidate → it will be the majority element

Idea:

Cancel out non-majority elements

Remaining element is the majority element

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Java Code
public class MajorityElement {

    public static int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int candidate = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }

        return candidate;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2,2,1,1,1,2,2};
        System.out.println("Majority Element: " + majorityElement(nums)); // Output: 2
    }
}

Code Explanation

Initialize candidate and count

If count drops to 0 → choose new candidate

Increment count if current element matches candidate

Decrement count otherwise

At the end, candidate is majority element

Dry Run (Example)
nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

Step 1: count=0 → candidate=2, count=1
Step 2: 2==candidate → count=2
Step 3: 1!=candidate → count=1
Step 4: 1!=candidate → count=0 → candidate=1
Step 5: 1==candidate → count=1
Step 6: 2!=candidate → count=0 → candidate=2
Step 7: 2==candidate → count=1

Final candidate=2 → Majority Element

Test Case
Input: nums = [3,3,4]
Output: 3

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

✅ Why This Problem Is Important

Tests array traversal + smart counting

Boyer-Moore is a classic O(1) space solution
